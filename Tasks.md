This document lists **data analysis questions** you can explore using **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.  
The questions are grouped into categories for clarity.

## 🛍️ Sales Performance  
1. What is the `total revenue` from all sales?  
2. What is the `average revenue per transaction`?

8. Which `day of the week` records the highest and lowest sales?  
9. Do `sales differ significantly between weekdays and weekends`?  
10. How does the `sales trend look across months`?  
11. Are there any `patterns in sales by hour vs weekday` (heatmap)?

## 💳 Payment Insights  
12. What is the `distribution of sales by payment method` (cash vs card)?  
13. Do customers `spend more on card transactions than cash`?  

---

## ☕ Product Insights  
14. What is the `price distribution of coffee products`?

## 🛠️ Skills to Apply  
- **NumPy** → Calculations (`sum`, `mean`, `median`, `percentiles`).  
- **Pandas** → Grouping, aggregation, filtering (`groupby`, `pivot_table`).  
- **Matplotlib** → `line plots`, `bar charts`, `pie charts`.  
- **Seaborn** → `heatmaps`, `boxplots`, `violin plots`, `countplots`.

## 🎯 Goal  
By exploring these questions, you will:  
- Understand overall `sales performance`.  
- Identify `best-selling and least-selling products`.  
- Discover `time-based sales patterns`.  
- Compare `payment preferences`.  
- Provide `business insights` for decision-making.
